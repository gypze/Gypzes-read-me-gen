# Professional README Generator 

## Description 

A README Generator that can quickly create a professional README.md for a new project

- As a junior developer I find that creating ways to make developing code easier, saves on time which in the long run will save money
- I built this project to gain a better understanding of node.js, as well as having a better grasp of what is truly neccessary for a README.md
- It solves the problem of having to decide what to put inside of the README.md, as the user is propted to put in the neccessary data
